          Wordsauce is live band Hip Hop with instrumentation rooted in Funk, mixed with a vocal style that balances intensely rhythmic lyrical form with catchy melodies.
          Their first full-length album, <em>The&nbsp;Flow</em> (2015), exhibited the broad spectrum of influences contained within the eclectic group of seven.
          Where forms of Rock influenced the direction of certain tunes on <em>The&nbsp;Flow</em>, the influences of Funk, RnB &amp; Soul have been refined and expanded on in their second album, <em>Juice</em>.
          The result is a polished and effective body of work that translates very well to their live show.
          Wordsauce has been pushing the boundaries of live Hip Hop music while delivering high-energy performances up and down the West Coast since 2009.
          In recent years, they have broken into the festival circuit with appearances at High Sierra Music Festival, Live Oak Music Festival, Surf Rodeo, Big Surreal and more.
          They have shared the stage with the likes of Jurrasic 5, Bone Thugz n Harmony, Del the Funky Homosapien, Freddie Gibbs, The Motet, Turkuaz, Soul Scratch, and many others.
          With their new album <em>Juice</em>, Wordsauce has shown that their music is constantly evolving and that theyâ€™re determined to take their live show all over the world.

              &ldquo;Wordsauce is a wildly dynamic band with an entertaining and diverse array of sounds. They caress and demand attention from the ears in equal parts with a mixture of reggae, hip hop, pop, and rock. Wordsauce have been playing at The Jester since 2010, and have always attracted a large, diverse, and energetic crowd. They consistently maintain a high-energy performance late into the evening. They have shown an ability to create a vibe that allows the venue to transition easily from a late dinner crowd, to the early bar goers, and all the way through to last call with a dance floor still full and begging for more. All band members are professional not only in their interactions with myself as an owner, but also with every member of my staff from the time they walk in to the time they leave the building. Similarly, they are professional in all aspects of their performance. Simply put, they aren't the regular bar band, they are professionals from start to finish and an absolute joy to work with. As an owner, when Wordsauce is in the house I can relax. That is not the case with many bands. They have always been respectful of my establishment and, without fail, always express their appreciation for being given the opportunity to play. They are a great band to book!&rdquo;
