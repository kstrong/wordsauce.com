      <p>
        Wordsauce was formed in 2009 by a group of musicians living in San Luis Obispo, CA. Built on the idea of 
        Cross-Contamination, the Sauce brings together members from highly diverse backgrounds and experience in many 
        styles of music. Our mission is to spread good vibes and awesome music from the central coast to the nation, 
        and eventually to the world.

        Their first release was in 2010, the &ldquo;Live in the Studio EP&rdquo;, which was recorded in a single session 
        at Cuesta College's recording studio. Since then, Wordsauce has played all over the state of California, 
        in backyards, bars, benefit shows, and outdoor festivals.

        during the month of August 2014.
